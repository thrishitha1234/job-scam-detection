# 💼 Job Offer Scam Detection

This project addresses the growing threat of job scam emails by developing a machine learning-based email classification system. Scammers use increasingly sophisticated tactics to impersonate legitimate employers, posing serious risks such as identity theft, financial loss, and emotional distress.

By leveraging natural language processing, feature engineering, and multiple machine learning classifiers, this tool helps job seekers identify fraudulent job offers in real time and supports broader goals in cybersecurity and digital trust.

## 🛑 Problem Statement

Job scam emails often mimic real offers, making them hard to detect using traditional spam filters. This project aims to bridge that gap by:

- Creating a hybrid model trained on real, reported, and synthetic scam email samples.
- Using text, metadata, and behavioral features for classification.
- Improving detection precision without wrongly flagging legitimate offers.

---

## ✨ Features

- Hybrid feature extraction: text, sender behavior, urgency terms, scam keywords, etc.
- Custom metadata indicators: non-HTTPS links, bait phrases, identity info requests.
- Balanced dataset with real-world diversity (Enron, surveys, synthetic).
- SHAP-based model interpretability for feature importance.
- Pre-trained Random Forest model (`grid_rf_model.pkl`) with high precision and recall.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Explore:
   - `complete_model_workflow/ipynb` → Full pipeline (EDA to evaluation)
   - `grid_rf_model.pkl` → Load and test best model
3. Predict on new data by importing the pickled model:
   ```python
   import joblib
   model = joblib.load("grid_rf_model.pkl")
   ```

## 📈 Results

| Model             | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Random Forest     | 96.7%    | 81.3%     | 66.8%  | 73.4%    |
| SVM (RBF Kernel)  | 96.4%    | 89.1%     | 53.7%  | 67.0%    |
| Naive Bayes       | 92.7%    | 47.3%     | 63.0%  | 54.0%    |

SHAP analysis confirmed key scam indicators:  
`scam_keywords`, `sender_domain_reputation`, `non_https_links`, `id_info_requested`, and `urgency_terms`.
